# Random-Matrix-Generator-using-multithreading

This is a simple C program that creates nxn big matrix generated by 5x5 matrix using multithreading.


* There are 4 threads which are Generate Thread,Mod Thread,ADD thread and Log thread.
#### Generate Thread:
* Generate thread generates 5x5 matrix and puts them into a global queue_1

#### Mod thread:
* Mod thread takes the generated matrix from global queue1 and takes all indexes mode by its first index and put it into another global queue_2

#### Log Thread:
* Log thread takes the generated matrix from global queue1 at the same time with mod thread. It puts it into nxn big queue by its indexes

#### Add Thread:
* Add thread takes thematrix that generated by mod thread from queue_2 and put finds the local sum.It adds the local sum into global sum.

All these 4 threads are working concurrently.Mutexes prevent the deadlock and critical section problems,and provides the synchronization.
